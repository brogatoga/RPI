Hypotheses for Lab 3, Checkpoint #2
=====================================================

Q: What if length of arrays is not equal to n? 
A: It depends on whether n is greater or less than the size of the array. 

Q: What if n is too small (less than size of the array) ?
A: If n is too small, then the function will not modify all the values
in the array, instead it will only square from a[0] to a[n-1].

Q: What if n is too big (larger than size of the array) ?
A: Then there might be a buffer overflow or segfault, because we will
iterate past the bounds of the array and into arbitary memory spaces which
may end up causing a memory access violation. 

Q: What if A array is larger than the B array?
A: Assuming that n is equal to length of A then, then there will be a 
segfault since once we go past B[len(A)-1], we will be writing into 
random memory spaces which is not supposed to happen. 

Q: What if A array is smaller than the B array?
A: Assuming that n is equal to len(A) again, then B will contain the
squared values of A, but it will also have len(B) - len(A) remaining
spots for elements that are unused since it is bigger than it needs to be. 

Q: How might the order of the variables impact the situation? 
A: The order that the variables were declared in main() will have an effect
on which memory addresses the arrays start at, but I highly doubt that it will
affect the actual functionality of the program in any way.
