CSCI 4430: Programming Languages
Homework 1

I have extensively tested my program and haven't found any bugs in
any of the three parts. 

I did all of the extra credit. Everything is described below:

========================================================================================

For extra credit for part 2, run the "loop2" predicate and input the parse tree string to
get the resulting sentence. You MUST end the inputted parse tree with a period in order for this to work.
For example:

	?- loop2.
	|: s(np(det(every),nom(noun(train))),vp(verb(arrived))).
	every train arrived.
			
	
For extra credit for part 3, I added in one new query and one new command, described below:
	- You can issue a "did" or "did not" command to two things at once, for example:
	
		|: the people ryan and fred left.
		|: the trains a and b did not stay.
		
		** Notice that you must use the plural form of the noun in order for this to work **
		
		
	- You can query and ask the system which things did or did not do what. For example:
	
		|: the people alice and bob left.
		|: the person carlos did not leave.
		|: the trains a and b left.
		|: the train c left.
		|: which people left?
		alice and bob
		|: which people did not leave?
		carlos
		|: which trains left?
		a, b, and c
		|: which bikes flew?
		None of them
		
		** Again, you must use the plural form of the noun in order for this to work **
		

Also for Part 3, entering in an invalid query or command followed by a period will cause the message "Huh?" to be shown.
For example:

	|: prog lang is fun.
	Huh?
