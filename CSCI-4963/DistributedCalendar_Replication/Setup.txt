Setup Instructions
============================

Requirements:
	- Python 2.7.x
	- Either "pip" or "easy_install" module
	- Flask and parse library
	- Unix-based system (optional)
	
To start the server:
	1. Modify the NodeData global variable in the server.py file
	2. Run "pip install flask"
	3. Run "pip install parse"
	4. run "python server.py [nodeID]"
		- where nodeID is an integer value from 1-4
	
Press Ctrl+C to terminate the application. This will terminate
both the web server and TCP socket server (they run on two separate threads).

Log files and calendar files are stored as log_N.txt and calendar_N.txt respectively,
where N is the node ID ranging from 1-4.
