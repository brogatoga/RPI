There are two ways to change the variables in the stimulation:

1. Modify the #define entries in constants.h file

2. Pass in command line arguments, like this: 
      ./test -n 50 -m 10 -c 8 -t 100

   The above example will make the stimulation run with 50 processes, 10 CPU cores, 8ms context switch
   time, and 100ms time slice for Round Robin. You can also pass in just one of (n, m, c, or t). But make
   sure that you also add in a space followed by a numerical value to specify the value for that 
   particular variable. 


** Also, if you compile with the DEBUG flag asserted, then you will also see in
   the output the times when processes start running or when a process is done 
   with its I/O burst and re-enters the ready queue.
