CSCI 4210: Operating Systems
Homework 4: File Storage Server

Ryan Lin (linr2@rpi.edu)


*** NOTE ***

1. My server does not always work correctly for binary files. I have no clue why.
2. My server does not support the uploading of extremely large files. Sometimes it will upload part of the file and then the other part will be corrupted.
